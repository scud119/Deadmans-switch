# Deadmans-switch
I am attempting to create a dead-mans switch to upload a file and have the user check in to verify your status. The goal is to also allow the user to add a series of email addresses in order to send the encrypted file and the key to decrypt the file, if the user does not check in for a significant portion of time. This is a tool designed to help those in places that have authoritarian governments. This program is still in very early development and most features are not working or implemented. I am fairly new to coding but decided to be ambitious.
